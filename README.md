version 1 is done this works using an h2 for the db using jbdc calls to it. frontend uses js and html with api calls to the backend. Data needs to be added manualy might to a webscapper maybe in v3. For v2 will change the backend to use springs.

Need to do:

fix the gui design.

change the sql so there are less calls to the DB.

create a temp storage so less calls to the DB are needed.
