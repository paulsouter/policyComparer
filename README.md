policyComparer Not finished!!!

The plan is to make an application to compare different policies based on things they have in combinations(tags) e.g. tax, weed, wate etc.

Need to do:

change gui so when you veiw policies the party is a link to the party page instead of desplaying all the party details.

fix the gui design.

change the sql so there are less calls to the DB.

create a temp storage so less calls to the DB are needed.
