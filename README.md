# policyComparer

Not finished!!!

The plan is to make an application to compare different policies based on things they have in combinations(tags) e.g. tax, weed, wate etc. 

Need to do:

  fix the dao to database calls 
  
  figure out why the policy entry box doesn't appear.
  
  fix the gui design.
  
  check to see if the api calls are working 
  
  check if the web interface is working.
  
  change the sql so there are less calls to the DB.
  
  create a temp storage so less calls to the DB are needed.
